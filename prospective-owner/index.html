<article id="buying-pricing"><h3>Buying decisions &amp; pricing <a href="#buying-pricing" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Salary sacrifice/leasing</strong> is a popular route via Octopus EV — "Everything covered: insurance, maintenance, tyres, tax." GT on salary sacrifice: ~£211/month net (3yr, 10k miles/year). GTS+ typically £300–370/month. Leasing often £350/month + VAT, 12k miles, 36 months.</p>

<p><strong>Finance:</strong> MY25 models at 2.9% APR; MY26+ at 4.9% APR. 1.9% APR deals available at some dealers on GTS models. Cash buyer discounts of up to £5,000 reported; finance discounts up to £3,000 at 1.9%.</p>

<p><strong>Government grant:</strong> MY26+ models eligible for the full £3,750 Electric Car Grant (previously £1,500 for non-"+" models). The £40k threshold matters for luxury car tax — some have managed to spec dealer cars under £40k.</p>

<p><strong>Stock vs factory order:</strong> Stock cars available with ~4 month delivery. Lots of stock reported — Autotrader listings increased from 55 to 75 in one month. Many come with driver packs people don't want. Some dealers had 20–30+ cars on site.</p>

<article id="model-differences"><h3>Model differences <a href="#model-differences" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>GT (180PS):</strong> Base model, 180bhp. No Devialet sound system (pedestrian warning sound only). No Nappa leather. Standard cloth seats. Telemetrics optional extra.</p>

<p><strong>GT Performance (220PS):</strong> 220bhp (same as GTS). Cloth seats — some owners prefer these to leather for durability. Devialet and telemetrics optional or standard depending on spec.</p>

<p><strong>GT Premium (DISCONTINUED in MY26):</strong> Was the "sweet spot" — 180PS with Nappa leather and Devialet. No longer available.</p>

<p><strong>GTS (220PS):</strong> 220bhp. Nappa leather seats, Devialet sound system, blue Brembo calipers all standard. GTS Premiere Edition available with all-blue interior and special badging. Floor mats included. Telemetrics standard.</p>

<article id="range-reality"><h3>Range reality (set expectations!) <a href="#range-reality" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p>WLTP is 226 miles (GTS). Real-world figures are significantly different:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Summer (15°C+):</strong> 180–210 miles</li>
<li><strong>Winter (0–5°C):</strong> 100–130 miles</li>
<li><strong>Motorway winter:</strong> Can be as low as 100–115 miles (confirmed by Renault/Alpine technical bulletin)</li>
</ul>

<p>EVs universally lose 30–40% range in cold weather. The small battery (52kWh usable) means drops are felt more acutely. Not ideal as an only car for long-distance commuters. Perfect as a second car or for short commutes.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I travel 52 miles each way a few times a week (all motorway) but no charger at the other end. Will I make it there and back in the GTS?" — "Risky. You'll be cutting it fine in winter."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Having owned two French electric cars and with a GTS on order, I strongly suggest: use a small piece of black sticky tape to cover the predicted range on the screen. It is a complete nonsense. Use the battery percentage."</p></blockquote>

<article id="insurance"><h3>Insurance <a href="#insurance" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p>Dramatically cheaper than comparable ICE hot hatches. Typical range: £200–300/year for experienced drivers with NCB.</p>

<ul>
<li>Aviva: "A little over £200 a year"</li>
<li>Admiral multicar: ~50% less than comparable ICE (A35 AMG comparison)</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article id="test-driving"><h3>Test driving &amp; recommended dealers <a href="#test-driving" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bristol Alpine (Sam) — "A good outfit"</li>
<li>Arnold Clark Hillington, Glasgow (Harry)</li>
<li>John Banks Cambridge — 20–30+ cars on site for viewing</li>
<li>Alpine Aberdeen — praised by multiple owners</li>
<li>Alpine Edinburgh (Michael) — "great guys"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Watch out:</strong> One dealer charged £30 for a test drive. Mixed dealer experiences — some "absolute melts," others praised. One owner reported a dealer forged their signature on handover documents.</p>

<p><strong>Alpine Customer Care phone line:</strong> "Reasonably helpful. It's a nice service."</p>

<article id="first-impressions"><h3>Common first impressions <a href="#first-impressions" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>"Haven't had that much fun in a hot hatch since the R5 GT Turbo."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Gets looked at just as much as my previous Astons but is much more suitable for pottering around London."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I have had more positive comments about my A290 than any other car I've owned."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Handling though, crikey, cocks its wheel like a p155ing dog."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Interior feels like a £70k car."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The sound system is awesome for a 36k car / blows the socks off 99% of other manufacturers."</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Common concerns:</strong> Range anxiety (especially winter), no cup holders, poor reverse camera quality, app reliability, torque steer (though "nowhere near as prevalent as reviewers lead you to believe").</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was very EV hesitant if I am honest, but initial outlay aside, the numbers make sense."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"After owning two Puma STs on the bounce, I was sceptical going the EV route but may be hard to return as I'm besotted."</p></blockquote>
