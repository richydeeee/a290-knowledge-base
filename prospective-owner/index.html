<article id="buying-pricing"><h3>Buying decisions &amp; pricing <a href="#buying-pricing" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Salary sacrifice/leasing</strong> is a popular route via Octopus EV - "Everything covered: insurance, maintenance, tyres, tax." GT on salary sacrifice: c.£211/month net (3yr, 10k miles/year). GTS+ typically £300–370/month. Leasing often £350/month + VAT, 12k miles, 36 months.</p>

<p><strong>Finance:</strong> MY25 models at 2.9% APR; MY26+ at 4.9% APR. 1.9% APR deals available at some dealers on GTS models. Cash buyer discounts of up to £5,000 reported; finance discounts up to £3,000 at 1.9%.</p>

<p><strong>Government grant:</strong> MY26+ models eligible for the full £3,750 Electric Car Grant (previously £1,500 for non-"+" models). The £40k threshold matters for luxury car tax - some have managed to spec dealer cars under £40k.</p>

<p><strong>Stock vs factory order:</strong> Stock cars available with c.4 month delivery. Lots of stock reported - Autotrader listings increased from 55 to 75 in one month. Many come with driver packs people don't want. Some dealers had 20–30+ cars on site.</p>

<article id="model-differences"><h3>Model differences <a href="#model-differences" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>GT (180PS):</strong> Base model, 180bhp. No Devialet sound system (pedestrian warning sound only). No Nappa leather. Standard cloth seats. Telemetrics optional extra.</p>

<p><strong>GT Performance (220PS):</strong> 220bhp (same as GTS). Cloth seats - some owners prefer these to leather for durability. Devialet and telemetrics optional or standard depending on spec.</p>

<p><strong>GT Premium (DISCONTINUED in MY26):</strong> Was the "sweet spot" - 180PS with Nappa leather and Devialet. No longer available.</p>

<p><strong>GTS (220PS):</strong> 220bhp. Nappa leather seats, Devialet sound system, blue Brembo calipers all standard. GTS Premiere Edition available with all blue interior and special badging. Floor mats included. Telemetrics standard.</p>

<article id="range-reality"><h3>Range reality (set expectations!) <a href="#range-reality" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p>WLTP is 226 miles (GTS). Real-world figures are significantly different:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Summer (15°C+):</strong> 180–210 miles</li>
<li><strong>Winter (0–5°C):</strong> 100–130 miles</li>
<li><strong>Motorway winter:</strong> Can be as low as 100–115 miles (confirmed by Renault/Alpine technical bulletin)</li>
</ul>

<p>EVs universally lose 30–40% range in cold weather. The small battery (52kWh usable) means drops are felt more acutely. For detailed range estimates by speed and conditions, see the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://evkx.net/models/alpine/a290/a290_gt/rangeandconsumption/">EVKX range and consumption calculator</a>.</p>
