<article id="charging"><h3>Charging issues <a href="#charging" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Car won't charge overnight:</strong> Most common issue - car goes to sleep, charger thinks it's not there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fix 1:</strong> Schedule via car app (not charger app), leave charger unlocked</li>
<li><strong>Fix 2:</strong> Use Octopus Go (not Intelligent) - more reliable</li>
<li><strong>Fix 3 (Zappi):</strong> Lock/unlock car, flash headlights off/on to reset</li>
<li><strong>Fix 4 (Ohme):</strong> Ohme can apply "CP wake up fix" - ring their support</li>
<li>Red light at charge port = charge failed/stopped</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Zappi + IOG:</strong> Works for some ("We have 2 A290s, both charge perfectly with Zappi and IOG using charger integration since July"). Fails for others - intermittent charging interruptions. Software update promised but reports suggest it doesn't fully fix the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Occasional charge failure:</strong> Sometimes the car just doesn't charge even when programmed. Requires manual override. App/communication glitch.</p>

<p><strong>Range showing wrong after charge:</strong> Charge to 90%, shows 121 miles, reset kW/mile → shoots to 179 miles. The "guess-o-meter" is based on recent driving history. Reset the trip computer for a more realistic figure - or just ignore range entirely and use battery percentage.</p>

<article id="app"><h3>App problems <a href="#app" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Complete app disconnect:</strong> All data disappeared from app. Usually a Renault server issue. Resolves itself (hours to days). "The app gave me option to reconnect the car" after server fix.</p>

<p><strong>Charge % display lag:</strong> App shows battery level 3–4 hours behind actual during charging. Known issue, no fix.</p>

<p><strong>"Subscription deactivated" message:</strong> Message in car's 4G network status. Usually a server glitch even though the subscription shows active.</p>

<p><strong>Android login loop:</strong> Known issue Jan 2026 after Renault backend changes. Fixed by app update.</p>

<p><strong>Radio no sound bug:</strong> Radio shows channel but no sound. <strong>Fix:</strong> Say "Hey Google" or quick press the microphone button on the wheel - when the system gets bored listening, normal volume returns.</p>

<article id="electrical"><h3>Software &amp; electrical <a href="#electrical" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>"Check Lights" warning:</strong> Appeared once, possibly auto lights related. Fix: switch to manual lights - went away next journey.</p>

<p><strong>Dashboard/infotainment reboot:</strong> Screens went black and rebooted twice during a trip. Rare occurrence, usually resolves itself.</p>

<p><strong>Speed limiter default on:</strong> Speed limiter selected as default every startup (annoying but no limit set). Press button to right of steering wheel twice to turn off.</p>

<p><strong>Telemetrics not loading:</strong> "Error loading app" message. If GT model: it's an optional extra (not standard). If GTS/GT Performance: should be standard, may need app update.</p>

<p><strong>Eco score popup:</strong> Pops up when switching off, shows 0/100. Says "press for more info" - press it and it disappears. Renault OS leaking through Alpine skin.</p>

<article id="mechanical"><h3>Mechanical issues <a href="#mechanical" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Rear brake disc corrosion:</strong> Heavy rust on rear discs due to regen braking. Occasionally drive with regen off to force use of physical brakes. Not a fault - normal for EVs with heavy regen.</p>

<p><strong>Driveshaft rust:</strong> Reports of driveshafts rusting within weeks. Concern especially for coastal owners. Underbody treatments (Lanoguard) mentioned as protection.</p>

<p><strong>Suspension creak:</strong> Creaking noise over rough roads. Multiple reports, no solution from Alpine yet.</p>

<p><strong>Front rattle:</strong> Rattling from driver's front side over bumps. Multiple dealer visits; some had suspension and brake parts replaced. One solution: subframe bolts tightening.</p>

<p><strong>Whistling heater:</strong> Whistling at fan levels 3–4. Related to pollen filter. Dealer can fix.</p>

<article id="paint-body"><h3>Paint &amp; body <a href="#paint-body" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Matt Grey Tornado maintenance:</strong> Use matte specific cleaner only (PH neutral). Products for shiny paint have fillers that ruin matte finish. Smart repairs are harder - dings and scrapes stand out more. PPF highly recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Leather seat deformation (GTS):</strong> Driver's seat develops two indents that don't smooth out. Alpine is aware of a "significant number of owners" experiencing this. Sourcing new leather supplier. Will inspect and replace leather/seat base at no cost once new materials are available. If buying again, some would choose GT Performance cloth seats instead.</p>

<p><strong>Wheel bolt corrosion:</strong> Wheel nuts rust/corrode quickly. 17mm black wheel bolt covers as first mod (almost universal). Car comes with locking wheel bolts "frustratingly in black!"</p>
