<article id="delivery"><h3>Delivery checks <a href="#delivery" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Ensure blue wheel centre caps are installed (if specced) — may be in the glove box</li>
<li>Check locking wheel nuts are aligned with valve stems and logos</li>
<li>Tyre pressures often set to 2.6bar (ECO) at delivery — causes harsh ride. <strong>Recommended: 33–35psi</strong> (from ~40psi delivery) reduces torque steer and improves ride</li>
<li>PPF recommended if ordered — some dealers install pre-delivery</li>
</ul>

<article id="app-setup"><h3>App setup <a href="#app-setup" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p>The My Alpine app is required but "buggy." Complete setup in the car first before attempting app connection.</p>

<ul>
<li>Android login loop issue (Jan 2026) — fixed by app update</li>
<li><strong>Kelec app</strong> available as backup (more reliable but fewer functions)</li>
<li>App often lags 3–4 hours behind actual battery level during charging</li>
<li>Server outages common — complete app disconnects happen</li>
</ul>

<article id="charging-setup"><h3>Charging setup (critical!) <a href="#charging-setup" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Do NOT overcomplicate.</strong> Use normal Octopus Go (not Intelligent Octopus Go) for reliability. Set the charge schedule in the car's app (e.g. 00:30–05:30), not in the charger app. Leave the charger unlocked.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The more integrated you try to make the setup (IOG + car + charger), the more likely it is to fail."</p></blockquote>

<p>The car has a ~0.1kW trickle to keep awake while plugged in.</p>

<p><strong>Ohme workaround:</strong> Download the separate Octopus app, link the car through that, disable scheduled charging in the Alpine app.</p>

<p><strong>Software update (late 2025):</strong> Alpine confirmed a fix for Intelligent Octopus Go incompatibility, but R5 owners report it "still doesn't intelligent charge" after the update. Zappi + IOG works for some, not others.</p>

<article id="first-week"><h3>First-week tips <a href="#first-week" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Disable lane-keep assist:</strong> Press far-right button by driver's door TWICE (shows yellow 'my perso' system off). Also disables overspeed warning. Resets every ignition cycle — must do each time.</p>

<p><strong>Speed camera alerts:</strong> Go to Google navigation settings in main infotainment (not CarPlay) → set 'alerts off'. Can't fully silence — still bongs even when muted.</p>

<p><strong>Seat quirks:</strong> Heated seat turns off if nobody sitting in it after 5 seconds. Heated seat/wheel don't work below 40% battery for pre-heating.</p>

<p><strong>Drive settings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OV (Overtake) button:</strong> Red button on steering wheel = temporary power boost</li>
<li>Hold drive mode button for a couple seconds = shortcuts to customise mode settings</li>
<li><strong>"My personal" mode trick:</strong> Everything sport except 'engine' set to eco = A/C in eco, limits top speed ~80mph, gives 3.7+ mi/kWh</li>
</ul>

<article id="warning-sound"><h3>Pedestrian warning sound <a href="#warning-sound" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p>Can be changed in drive settings. The 'Alpine signature' is "not very pleasant and rather loud." The 'Neutral' sound is much more pleasing.</p>

<article id="common-issues"><h3>Common new-owner issues <a href="#common-issues" class="anchor-link">§</a></h3>

<p><strong>Rear brakes seizing:</strong> Rear brakes bind after washing or sitting in rain/cold — regen means physical brakes are rarely used. Fix: drive briefly after washing, or occasionally drive with regen off.</p>

<p><strong>Torque steer:</strong> Most say "nowhere near as prevalent as reviewers lead you to believe." Often confused with lane-keep assist pulling the wheel. Setting tyres to 33–35psi significantly reduces it.</p>

<p><strong>Dashboard quirks:</strong> Eco score pops up when switching off (shows 0/100) — Renault OS leaking through Alpine skin. No equaliser adjustment on sound system. Heated seat switch appears in LHD position on screen.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic hum:</strong> Normal high-pitched whining from front console/firewall when car is awake. DC-DC converter noise — not a fault.</p>
