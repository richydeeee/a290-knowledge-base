**Subject:** Partnership opportunity — a290.wiki (Alpine A290 Knowledge Base)

Hi [Name / Team],

I'm building **a290.wiki** — an independent knowledge base for Alpine A290 owners. It's a free resource covering tips, how-tos, accessories, and troubleshooting, compiled from owner communities.

Your [frunks / key covers] are already featured on the site as a recommended product, and I'd love to explore a simple affiliate or referral arrangement.

**What I'm offering:**
- Featured placement on the Accessories page with direct links to your store
- Mention in relevant how-to guides and tips
- Exposure to a growing, targeted audience of A290 owners

**What I'm looking for:**
- A small commission on referred sales (e.g. 5-10%), or
- A discount code for my readers (which I'd promote on the site)

The site is brand new but I believe it's the first dedicated A290 knowledge base online, and I'll be sharing it across the main owner communities (PistonHeads, Facebook groups).

Happy to chat further if you're interested.

Best,
Rich

**a290.wiki**
